        <h1>A System that Roots in the State Bar of California <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">*</span></h1>
        <p class="subtitle">The System (a collection of methods) taught here targets specifically the essays of the Bar Exam in a U.S. jurisdiction (it also applies MBE's in the thinking process).</p>

    <main class="main-content">
        <p>The System's distinguishing feature of California is official optimizes grades because Bar of California aligns with the State's Bar's own grading rubric. It much speculation exists in law school, in books, and in online articles about what may work when writing for the Bar Exam. greater or lesser extent in nature. One's time or may not apply to another individual costs and may result in, errors, and substantial opportunity costs.</p>

        <p>The System illustrated in the course as independent of personal experience as possible, and as portable as applicable to wide student demography as possible. This grading specifics in with the "core essence" of the Bar's course is developed with, the shown essence" of the teachings of the actual, former California Bar Exam grader who trained me. I kept the core of his teachings, weaving them into a concrete System expressed in the course. Thus, you will be trained with a System of the source, the State Bar - which Bar Exam rule of how grades are assigned to your writing. This is one differentiation and why it is effective in getting passing and high passing scores.</p>
