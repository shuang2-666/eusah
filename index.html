        <p>The System (a collection of methods) taught here targets specifically the essays and the Performance Test of a Bar Exam in a U.S. jurisdiction (it also applies to MBEs in the thinking process). 

The System's distinguishing feature is its official roots straight from the State Bar of California. The System optimizes grades because it closely aligns with the State Barâ€™s own grading rubric. </p>
<p>Much speculation exists in law school, in books, and in online articles about what may work when writing for the Bar Exam. It is often from individual personal experience arbitrary to a greater or lesser extent in nature. One's tip may or may not apply to another individual  and may result in trials, errors, and substantial opportunity costs.</p> 
        <p>The System illustrated in the course is as independent of personal experience as possible, and as portable as applicable to wide student demography as possible. This course is developed with the "core essence" of the Bar's grading specifics in mind, as shown by the teachings of the actual, former California Bar Exam grader who trained me.  I kept the core of his teachings, weaving them into a concrete System expressed in the course. Thus, you will be trained with a system of approaching and executing Bar Exam writing straight from the source, the State Bar - which directs the rule of how grades are assigned to your writing. This is one differentiation and why it is effective in getting passing and high passing scores. </p>
        <p>*Please note that I am not an ex-bar grader. However, I am admitted to the State Bar of California. I was trained by the best in the craft of Bar Exam grading and coaching, in my opinion. Among the many comments I received from the ex-bar grader: "I am extremely impressed! The contract essay is arguably the most difficult in the library. You scored much higher than the vast majority of anyone doing this essay." I have the confidence to help you see the same essence and optimize your ability to get the same passing result. </p>
